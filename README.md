# TelegramBot
Here's a demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11pczswYT1QwOjwoDOeZwYezK20Es63LZ

This is a simple Telegram bot which is meant to send reminders for birthdays and important events.

I initially made it in repl.it thus there's a lot of irrelevant files. 
All the code you'll need can be found in main.py! 

If you want to host it 24/7 on web services like Heroku, you may need the procfile!
